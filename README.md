My Master's level project which is a functional self-contained network tool capable of identifying IOCs using a well established SNORT Egress rule-set that could be deployed on an internal network in a bastion position to perform packet analysis, cross-examining against existing signatures. It is a deployable tool which uses knowledge based detection to determine if egress network packets are malicious without interfering with the performance of the network through passive listening. The tool aims to remove unnecessary bloat information cluttering the interface and focus on providing a digestible set of core details whilst maintaining a intuitive learning curve for users.
